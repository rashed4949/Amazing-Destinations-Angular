# Amazing Destinations
The main idea of this project was to provide the user a complete platform where they can plan their trip with budget. Our motivation was to encourage people that they can visit any place with a small amount of money and to show the user that with a proper financial plan one can travel a lot.However, the system needs to be trained more in order to generate intelligent and more precise outputs which leaves the necessity of more data.
